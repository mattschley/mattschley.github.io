                <li>1. How well did the USA appear to "flatten the curve"? Was it more of a "plateau" than "flattening"?</li><br>
                <li>2. Did your state fare better or worse than average in containing the spread of Covid-19? Why do you think that was?</li><br>
                <li>3. What were the most critical months in the spreading of Covid-19?</li>
            </ul>
